⚙️ Command Structure

📜 Folder Breakdown

📂 commands
 ├── 📂 moderation
 ├── 📂 music
 ├── 📂 fun
 ├── 📂 economy
 ├── 📂 utility
 ├── 📂 ai
 ├── 📂 config

Each command follows a modular structure, allowing for easy expansion:

module.exports = {
  name: "commandName",
  description: "Command description",
  usage: "!command <args>",
  cooldown: 5,
  execute(client, message, args) {
    // Command logic
  }
};

🔧 Advanced Configuration

Custom Prefix per Guild

Modify config.json and enable database storage for prefixes.

const guildPrefix = await db.get(`prefix_${message.guild.id}`) || "!";

Rate Limiting & Cooldowns

if (cooldowns.has(command.name)) {
  return message.reply("You're using this command too quickly!");
}
cooldowns.set(command.name, Date.now() + command.cooldown * 1000);

Logging & Debugging

Use a logging system like Winston or Pino.

const logger = require("winston");
logger.info("Bot is starting...");
